#summary Source Base Structure
#labels Phase-Requirements

To simplify project structure the following layout of source files is used.

= General Rules =
 * All source files should be grouped into modules/projects
 * A module/project lives in its own folder named trunk/sources/{{{<projectname>}}}
  * Example: IR project folder is trunk/sources/ir
 * Every project has the following mandatory headers:
  * {{{<project_prefix>}}}`_`dep.hpp for explicit listing of external dependencies
  * {{{<project_prefix>}}}`_`iface.hpp for external interfaces
  * {{{<project_prefix>}}}`_`impl.hpp for internal declarations
