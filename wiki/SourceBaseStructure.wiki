#summary Source Base Structure
#labels Phase-Requirements

To simplify project structure the following layout of source files is used.

= General Rules =
 * All source files should be grouped into modules/projects
 * A module/project lives in its own folder named trunk/sources/{{{<projectname>}}}
  * Example: IR project folder is trunk/sources/ir


= Namespaces =

Each component must be in it's own namespace. If component consists of several sub-systems each one must be in an own nested namespace
