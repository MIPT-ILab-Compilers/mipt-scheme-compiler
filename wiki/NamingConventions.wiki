#summary Naming Conventions
#labels Phase-Requirements

=General Rules=
Mostly we would like to adopt [http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq13-apis.html QT Style API Design] and inherit naming system for it.
More rules will be given here explicitly. Read Qt Documentation for now

=Types and Classes=
Type names should reflect entities they represents. A name should begin with an uppercase letter. To distinct parts of name use uppercase letter at the beginning of every part.

Examples: `NameOfTheClass`, `SomeMysteriousEntity`

=Function names=
Class methods and function names should begin with a lowercase letter and highlight parts by uppercase letters. Exception for this rule is the Constructor and Destructor for classes - they aliased to the class names.

Examples: `tryNotToGetWorried();``tryNotToTurnOnTo();``troublesThatUpsetYou();`

Not all of the source code comply with that BUT it should. It mostly applies to Get/Set routines so if you see `my_object->GetSmth()` feel free to turn it into `my_object->smth()` and change the declaration for routine.

=Variables and Class Members=

Variables and class members should be all lowercase. Parts of name should be separated by '_'.

Example:`very_important_var`

In order to use shorter name for getter routines the private class members should have some suffix ( like `_priv` or just `_`) after it.

Example:

{{{
class MyClass
{
    int num_priv;
public:
    inline int num() const
    {
        return num_priv;
    }
}

void f()
{
    MyClass my;
    int a = my.num();
}
}}}
