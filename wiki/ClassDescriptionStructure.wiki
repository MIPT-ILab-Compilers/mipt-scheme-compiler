#summary Class description structure
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Class header =

Class description should be in the _{{{<class_name>}}}.hpp_ file, and should have the following format:

{{{
/*
 *comment, as described in the [[Source Base Structure]] 
 */

#pragma once


include for all types, involved in the class definition.


namespace usedNamespace
{
    prototypes of classes, mentioned below only by pointers or references.
}
...

namespace <nameOfComponent>
{

nessesary using directives

support functions prototypes

class className :parents
{
public:
    public constructors, destructor and interface methods
private:
    private members


};
}
}}}

= Inline functions =

If a member function has a one-line body, and that line won't break the 80-char limit, it can be (but strongly *not recommended*) defined inside the class description in two ways:

{{{
int fooFun (int arg1, int arg2) const { return arg1 - arg2; }
}}}

{{{
int fooFun (int arg1, int arg2) const
{ return divideTwoNumbersSafely( arg1, arg2); }
}}}
